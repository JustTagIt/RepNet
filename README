*************************************
STATUS: Maintaining
Repository: repnet module on Node.js, with codes for experimental evaluation
Dependencies: Node.js version 0.11.13-release (Built from Source)
*************************************
Node.js Git Repository (the right version to support this module)
	https://github.com/joyent/node/tree/v0.11.13-release



*************************************
USAGE
*************************************
"net=require('./repnet');" in the place of "net=require('net');" in your code
Most Net module APIs are supported for now.

NOTE: if file "repnet.net" is in the same directory of "server.js" and "client.js"



*************************************
Example Code Usage
*************************************
Run without changing directory

The files whose filenames start with numbers are for cluster evalution.
To do this, you will need two more files named IPLIST. Each one is for a rack (now 2 racks A and B are demanded).
Also, file 1_connectserver.sh command requires clusterssh, a useful tool to enable simultanous ssh commands in a cluster.

//Sample IPLIST FILE: serverlistA.list
//First Row: the number of servers in rackA
//Rest of the file : NAT port numbers, (one per row), because our cluster is behind a NAT.
//To Change this to IP addresses, you should  
5
30101
30102
30103
30104

30106
//End of file of serverlistA.list


*************************************
IMPORTANT NOTES
*************************************
Though evaluation among cluster servers has a bunch of prerequisites, our sample code is still available to run on localhost.
Please read the usage headers of <client.js, repclient.js, repsynclient.js>, just with "node server.js" running on localhost!
